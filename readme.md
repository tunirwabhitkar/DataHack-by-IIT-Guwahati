### Project Title
**Predicting Flu Vaccine Uptake Using Machine Learning**

### Project Description
This project aims to predict the likelihood of individuals receiving two types of flu vaccines: the xyz flu vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine. Using a dataset provided by a DataHack hackathon, we develop a machine learning model to predict the probabilities of vaccine uptake based on various demographic, behavioral, and opinion-based features.

### Key Objectives
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load and explore the provided dataset to understand the distribution and characteristics of the features and target variables.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
3. **Model Selection and Training**: Build and train a machine learning model pipeline using a LightGBM classifier within a multi-output classification framework.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model's hyperparameters using grid search with cross-validation to improve performance.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using ROC AUC scores for both target variables.
6. **Prediction and Submission**: Predict on the test dataset and prepare a submission file in the required format.

### Steps and Implementation
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Load training and test datasets.
   - Perform initial data exploration to understand the data structure, identify missing values, and visualize distributions.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values using imputation techniques.
   - Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
   - Scale numerical features for better model performance.
   - Combine preprocessing steps into a pipeline for streamlined processing.

3. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Define a LightGBM classifier as the base model.
   - Use a multi-output classifier to handle the two target variables simultaneously.
   - Split the data into training and validation sets to evaluate model performance during training.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Define a parameter grid for LightGBM hyperparameters.
   - Use GridSearchCV to perform exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator.
   - Select the best model based on cross-validated performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model using ROC AUC scores for both the xyz flu vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine.
   - Calculate the mean ROC AUC score as the overall evaluation metric.

6. **Prediction and Submission**:
   - Predict probabilities on the test dataset using the best model.
   - Prepare a submission file in the required format, containing respondent IDs and predicted probabilities for both vaccines.

### Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: The primary programming language for this project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For model building, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **LightGBM**: For implementing the gradient boosting model.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization (if needed).

### Expected Outcomes
- A machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of individuals receiving the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines.
- A submission file containing the predicted probabilities for the test dataset.
- Insights into the most influential features affecting vaccine uptake.

### Conclusion
By applying machine learning techniques to predict flu vaccine uptake, this project contributes to understanding the factors influencing vaccination behavior. The model's predictions can aid public health initiatives in targeting interventions and improving vaccine coverage.

This project demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation in a real-world scenario, providing a comprehensive workflow for tackling similar predictive modeling problems.
